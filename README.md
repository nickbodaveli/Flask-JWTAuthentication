# JWT Authentication Example
This project demonstrates a basic implementation of JSON Web Token (JWT) based authentication, typically for a web API. It covers user registration, login, token generation, and securing access to protected routes/resources using JWTs.

Why it Does it
This project showcases a crucial aspect of modern web application security and backend development, covering:

* User authentication and authorization principles.

* Secure password hashing (e.g., with Bcrypt).

* JWT token creation and validation using the PyJWT library.

* Handling protected API endpoints.

Features
* User registration.

* User login (obtaining a JWT).

* Access to protected routes using the generated JWT.
